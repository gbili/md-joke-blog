# Simplest Whitelist Blog
A package that will let serve your Markdown files as blog posts. These posts have to live in their own git repository (let's call it `my-posts` for illustration purposes). Posts need to be stored inside `my-posts/content`. For example `my-posts/content/hello-world-post.md

## Initial Setup
```
npm i -P md-toy-blog

cd my-blog-posts-dir
mkdir content
mv *.md content

cp -ifR ../nodeblog-consumer/* ./

npm install

git add .
git commit -m "feat: bloggify my markdown files"

npm run makeconfig
npm run develop
```

## After setup usage
Now that everything is set up. You can simply edit your blog posts and track the changes with `git add . && git commit -m "feat: new blog post about stuff"`. Make sure to use `conventional-commits` messages to allow `semantic-realease` to bump up the versions for you, and let your ci deploy the changes to your production.

## Nodess (Node Simplest Setup)

This is a skeleton for developing Nodejs projects with:
- testing (Mocha and Chai)
- ES6 support (babel)
- nodemon for automatic reloading

## Usage 
### "Installation"
First off get it on your machine:
- clone the repo, and edit `package.json`
- delete upstream reference or delete `.git` and re-init git repo
- change package name if you like

### Development
Start coding:
- start the `development` server
  ```
  npm run develop
  ```
- from there you can add your own files and strucutre in `src/`

### Testing
- Add your own tests in the `./tests/*`, and run them with:
  ```
  npm run tests
  ```
### Production
- Build your sourcecode to transpile ES6 into ES5:
  ```
  npm run build
  ```
- Upload it to your server and serve it:
  ```
  npm run serve
  ```
